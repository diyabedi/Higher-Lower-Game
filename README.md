# Higher-Lower-Game
#OVERVIEW
The Higher-Lower-Game is a Python project designed to compare Instagram follower counts between various accounts based on a pre-existing dataset. The game is built on the concept of guessing whether the next Instagram account in the dataset has more or fewer followers than the current account. Players will make a series of choices, and they will be scored based on their ability to predict correctly.
This project leverages a dataset of Instagram accounts, which includes their follower counts, and provides a fun, interactive way to test one's knowledge of Instagram accounts and their popularity. 
Note: The dataset is already given by me

#Program Structure:
1. higherlower.py: This is the main Python file that contains the game logic. It prompts the player with Instagram accounts and their respective follower counts, and the player must guess whether the next account has higher or lower followers.

2. datafile: This file contains the dataset of Instagram accounts, including their names and follower counts. The data is structured in a way that allows it to be easily accessed and used within the game logic.

3. arthighlow: The logo or graphical assets used within the game, enhancing the visual presentation of the project. This might include images such as the game's title logo or decorative assets used in the game interface.
